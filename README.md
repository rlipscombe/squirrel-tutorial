# A Squirrel Tutorial

At Electric Imp, our users program their devices and agents with the [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/) programming language.

I only know just enough squirrel to be dangerous, so I thought it might be a useful learning exercise to write a squirrel language tutorial.

Note that the Electric Imp platform uses a slightly modified form of Squirrel 3.0.4, so that's the version I'll be concentrating on.
